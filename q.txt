Has a default constructor.
The Play class should have a private member std::vector<Spot*> matrix and a std::vector<Spot*>& getMatrix() function.
It should have a function initPlay(int numPersonas, int numSnares, int matrixWidth, int matrixHeight) that initializes the gameplay with a certain number of each object at random locations in the matrix.
The Play class should provide a function playCycle(int maxCycles, double snareTriggerDistance) that:
Runs the game for a certain number of cycles.
In each cycle, shifts all Persona objects in the matrix to the right by calling the shift(1,0) function.
Checks for any Snare objects near each Persona. If a Snare object is within the snareTriggerDistance, the Snare's implement function is called on the Persona.
Checks if any Persona has stepped outside of the matrix. If so, the game is won by that Persona. Prints
"Persona has won the game!"  and ends the game cycle.
If the maximum number of cycles is reached and no persona won, it prints
"Maximum number of cycles reached. Game over."
Finally, write a main-3.cpp file to simulate the gameplay using the Play class and demonstrate how it handles the gameplay mechanics and victory conditions.
